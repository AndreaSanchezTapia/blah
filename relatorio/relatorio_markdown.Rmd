knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,

## R Markdown

This is an R __Markdown__ document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the __output of any embedded R code chunks within the document__. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = TRUE, fig.height= 6, fig.cap= "__Figura 1 plot de pressão__"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## figura no texto

![](../figs/figura01.png)

## figura no chunk

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/figura01.png")
```
